# Daily-bike-rental-ridership-perdiction-using-ANN

## Project Overview

This project is PROJECT 1 of my Deep learning class at UDACITY. In this project, I built my first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.\
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

## Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Udacity Workspaces (Recommended)

Udacity Workspaces provide remote connection to GPU-enabled instances right from the classroom. Refer to the classroom lesson for this project to find an overview of navigating & using Jupyter notebook Workspaces.

## Google COlab(Optional)

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with

> - Zero configuration required
> - Free access to GPUs
> - Easy sharing

## Install

> - Python 3
> - NumPy
> - TensorFlow 1.x
> - Keras 2.x
